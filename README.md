# Lab: Your Portfolio

## Aspects of the work
1. Created index.html, resume.html and bio.html and linked them together. Index.html is the home page that includes my photo as well as links to resume.html and bio.html. 
2. I changed the background color of my web pages and the text color of h1 and h3 with CSS. I also adjusted the size of my photo and changed font style in CSS file. 
3. Checked HTML files using Markup Validation Service. 
4. Checked CSS validation by using CSS validation Service (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

## Collaboration
I did the lab on my own. I learned the basic of HTML5 and how to use external CSS file styling html pages. 

## Hours spent on the lab
I spent 2.5 hours on the lab.
